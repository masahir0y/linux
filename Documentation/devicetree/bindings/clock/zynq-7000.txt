Device Tree Clock bindings for the Zynq 7000 EPP

The Zynq EPP has several different clk providers, each with there own bindings.
The purpose of this document is to document their usage.

See clock_bindings.txt for more information on the generic clock bindings.
See Chapter 25 of Zynq TRM for more information about Zynq clocks.

== Clock Controller ==
The clock controller is a logical abstraction of Zynq's clock tree. It reads
required input clock frequencies from the devicetree and acts as clock provider
for all clock consumers of PS clocks.

Required properties:
 - #clock-cells : Must be 1
 - compatible : "xlnx,ps7-clkc"
 - reg : SLCR offset and size taken via syscon < 0x100 0x100 >
 - ps-clk-frequency : Frequency of the oscillator providing ps_clk in HZ
		      (usually 33 MHz oscillators are used for Zynq platforms)

Optional properties:
 - clocks : as described in the clock bindings
 - clock-names : as described in the clock bindings
 - fclk-enable : Bit mask to enable FCLKs statically at boot time.
		 Bit [0..3] correspond to FCLK0..FCLK3. The corresponding
		 FCLK will only be enabled if it is actually running at
		 boot time.

Clock inputs:
The following strings are optional parameters to the 'clock-names' property in
order to provide an optional (E)MIO clock source.
 - swdt_ext_clk
 - gem0_emio_clk
 - gem1_emio_clk
 - mio_clk_XX		# with XX = 00..53
...

Example:

		#clock-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "xlnx,ps7-clkc";
		ps-clk-frequency = <33333333>;
		reg = <0x100 0x100>;
		# optional props
		clocks = <&clkc 16>, <&clk_foo>;
		clock-names = "gem1_emio_clk", "can_mio_clk_23";
	};
