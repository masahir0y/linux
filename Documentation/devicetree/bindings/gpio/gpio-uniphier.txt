UniPhier GPIO controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "socionext,uniphier-gpio".
- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device.
- gpio-controller: marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
- #gpio-cells: should be three.
    The 1st cell is the bank number.
    The 2nd cell is the line number in the bank.
    The 3rd cell is the flags.
- gpio-banks: the number of GPIO banks.

Optional properties:
- gpio-ranges: interaction with the pinctrl device.  See gpio.txt
- gpio-ranges-group-names: interaction with the pinctrl device.  See gpio.txt

Example:
	gpio: gpio@55000000 {
		compatible = "socionext,uniphier-gpio";
		reg = <0x55000000 0x200>;
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <3>;
		gpio-ranges = <&pinctrl 0 0 0>;
		gpio-ranges-group-names = "port_range";
		gpio-banks = <26>;
	};
